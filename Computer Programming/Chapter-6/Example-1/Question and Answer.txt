Write a program in C that calculates the average exam
grade for a class of 10 students.
? Note That:
? You must only use WHILE loop.
? You must declare an array called as “grd” for the inputs.
? You must declare a variable called as “avr” with data type of
double that includes the average value.
? Display the average value with two decimal places.
? The output is like below for example:
? “The Average of ten grades is 36.45”

Answer
int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
int i=0,grd[10],sum=0;
double avr;
while(i<10)
{
printf("Enter the grade %d=",i+1);
scanf("%d",&grd[i]);
sum+=grd[i];
i++;
}
avr=sum/10.0;
printf("The Average of ten grades is %.2f",avr);
return 0;
}
