Write a C program to sort the three numbers form the user in ascending order.
Note That:
- All numbers are entered by the user in the function Main().
- The sorted numbers must be displayed in the function Main().
- Only three variables must be declared in the function Main() and NOT any array.
- Define a function called as “SortNumbers” that sorts the three numbers and NO returns any values, and takes the only three variables.
- In the function “SortNumbers”, only one variable must be declared.
