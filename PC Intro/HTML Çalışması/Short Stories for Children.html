<td>Once upon a time there was a dear little girl who was loved by every one who looked at her, but most of all by her grandmother, and there
was nothing that she would not have given to the child. Once she gave her a little cap of red velvet, which suited her so well that she would never
wear anything else. So she was always called Little Red Riding Hood.</td>
<td>ONCE upon a time there were four little Rabbits, and their names wereâ€” Flopsy, Mopsy, Cotton-tail, and Peter. They lived with their Mother
in a sand-bank, underneath the root of a very big fir tree. "NOW, my dears," said old Mrs. Rabbit one morning, "you may go into the fields or
down the lane, but don't go into Mr. McGregor's garden: your Father had an accident there; he was put in a pie by Mrs. McGregor."</td>
<td>ONCE there was a gentleman who married, for his second wife, the proudest and most haughty woman that was ever seen. She had, by a
former husband, two daughters of her own humor, who were, indeed, exactly like her in all things. He had likewise, by another wife, a young
daughter, but of unparalleled goodness and sweetness of temper, which she took from her mother, who was the best creature in the world.</td>
